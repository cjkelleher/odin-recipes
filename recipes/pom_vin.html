    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Today I wanted to share with you a delicious recipe for a
        pomegranate vinaigrette that will have you licking the bowl
        at the end of the meal. This is a recipe that I developed while
        working in professional restaurants and actually got to put
        on the menu. It goes great in a fall or winter salad or to pair
        with a lighter protein like salmon.

            honey into the pitcher of a relatively strong blender.
        </li>
        <li>Run the blender on high until the mixture is homogenous</li>
        <li>With the blender still running, slowly drizzle in the canola oil.
            (Olive oil can develope an off taste if blended too much so we save
            that for last.)

        <li>Once everything is incorporated season to taste with
