        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>I'm going to share with you my secret recipe for a simple thai peanut sauce that I use
            on my Peanut Butter and Jelly Brussels Sprouts. Because it was designed to be used as a base 
            for the sprouts to lay on, this sauce is a little thicker than more traditional peanut sauces.
            This sauce will go great on brussels (obviously) or a simple noodle salad.
